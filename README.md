# harvesting-import-service

Microservice that harvests knowledge about a harvesting-task from the linked annotated documents 
and writes the resulting triples to the database.

## Installation

To add the service to your stack, add the following snippet to docker-compose.yml:

```
services:
  harvesting-import:
    image: lblod/harvesting-import-service:x.x.x
    volumes:
      - ./data/files:/share
```

## Configuration

### Delta

```
  {
    match: {
      predicate: {
        type: 'uri',
        value: 'http://www.w3.org/ns/adms#status'
      },
      object: {
        type: 'uri',
        value: 'http://lblod.data.gift/harvesting-statuses/ready-for-importing'
      }
    },
    callback: {
      url: 'http://harvesting-import/delta',
      method: 'POST'
    },
    options: {
      resourceFormat: 'v0.0.1',
      gracePeriod: 1000,
      ignoreFromSelf: true
    }
  }
```
   
## REST API

### POST /delta

starts the import of the given harvesting-tasks into the db

Returns 204 NO-CONTENT if no harvesting-tasks could be extracted.

Returns 200 SUCCESS if the harvesting-tasks where successfully processes.

### Harvesting Task

Periodically this service will create harvesting tasks. The task describes the status and progress of the harvesting flow.

#### Class

`harvesting:HarvestingTask`

### Properties

 Name | Predicate | Range | Definition 
--- | --- | --- | ---
status | `adms:status` | `adms:Status` | Status of the task, initially set to `http://lblod.data.gift/harvesting-statuses/ready-for-collecting`
created |`dct:created`|`xsd:dateTime`| Datetime of creation of the task
modified |`dct:modified`|`xsd:dateTime`| Datetime on which the task was modified
creator |`dct:creator`|`rdfs:Resource`| Creator of the task, in this case the harvest-initiation-service <http://lblod.data.gift/services/harvest-initiation-service>
harvestingCollection |`prov:generated`|`harvesting:HarvestingCollection`| HarvestingCollection generated by the task

#### Harvesting task statuses

The status of the task will be updated by other micro-services to reflect the progress of the harvesting progress. The following statuses are known:

- http://lblod.data.gift/harvesting-statuses/ready-for-collecting
- http://lblod.data.gift/harvesting-statuses/ready-for-importing
- http://lblod.data.gift/harvesting-statuses/importing
- http://lblod.data.gift/harvesting-statuses/success
- http://lblod.data.gift/harvesting-statuses/failure

## HarvestingCollection

The service will create the harvesting collection that will contain the resource/file than needs to be downloaded (and later harvested). This will be updated further/enriched by the `harvest-collector-service`.

### Class

`harvesting:HarvestingCollection`


### Properties

 Name | Predicate | Range | Definition 
--- | --- | --- | ---
status | `adms:status` | `adms:Status`| Status of the task, initially set to `http://lblod.data.gift/collecting-statuses/not-started`
remoteDataObject | `dct:hasPart` | `nfo:RemoteDataObject` | page/resource to be downloaded/collected for this harvesting task

### Collecting statuses

The status of the task will be updated by other micro-services to reflect the progress of the collecting progress. The following statuses are known:

- http://lblod.data.gift/collecting-statuses/not-started

## RemoteDataObject

The service will create an initial remote-data-object for source URL which will be downloaded by the download-url-service.

### Class

`nfo:RemoteDataObject`

### Properties

The model of the remote data object is described in the README of the download-url-service. 
But the following will be needed to initiate a download:

 Name | Predicate | Range | Definition 
--- | --- | --- | ---
status | `adms:status` | `adms:Status`| Status of the task, initially set to `http://lblod.data.gift/file-download-statuses/ready-to-be-cached`
source |`nie:url`| | the URL that needs to be downloaded
